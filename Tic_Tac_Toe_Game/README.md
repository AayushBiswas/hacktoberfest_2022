## About The Project

As the first project of me and [Arian](https://github.com/arian0zen) this one was very special. We wonder how this has been completed in this little time. Anyway, as you all can see it is a web based, 2 players game with multiple funcionalities. This game has ay interactive and colorful UI which has been appriciated by many of our users(friends). 

Key points :
* This type of project is great strat for beginners.
* It helps to understand about the integration of learning in early phase. Like the use of javascript and logic building to perform user interaction on web page.
* This type of games, specially the UI teaches a lot. You can be familier with Positioning of elements and responsive UI after this type of projects.
* It is strongly recomended to build a very small project like this before moving on landing page and full stack projects.
* This type of projects gives you exposure to express your creativity. You can experiment with the UI and funcionalities.

This game helped us to learn about many things, like we saw there are millions of tic tac toe around the internet, specially, vs AI. But none of them having all these functionalities all togather. Like most of the game don't have the feature to play with player names. If they have somehow, there will not be a option to reset the round. Along with that no one added rounds in a tic tac toe game. So we tried to implement this all togather. :smile:

### Built With

Well, this doesn't include a heavy tech stack but fundamentals. Thought bootstrap is included but not used in a good manner. Most of designs rely on Vanilla CSS.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* Create repository.

### Prerequisites

There are few presrequisites, such as

* Understanding of HTML
* A good hold in CSS
* Advance dom manupulation using JavaScript
* Conditional statements in javaScript
* (Advance yet helpful) Use color palets! Check out [Color hunt](https://colorhunt.co)

And the most important thing, go with a design or wireframe. Don't go blank it will take you long and you will not be able to take decisions. We created a wireframe for this project using [Balsemiq cloud](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/cloud/).

* It is free for a month you can use it to make wireframes.
* If you dont want to use it you can use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to make a images based page and then turn it into your design.
* You can get a Canva subscription free if you have [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). If you son't have it apply now, it's free and a must have for students. 

* Wireframe for this project
